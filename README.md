Wither
======

Control what players can spawn a Wither, what damage the Wither can do, and what worlds the Wither can be spawned in.. This plugin will prevent players without the proper permission node from creating a Wither by placing Soul Sand and Wither Skulls. You are also able to turn off block damage caused by WIther and more! This will not stop damage from the Wither when it is directed at a Player or Mob.
